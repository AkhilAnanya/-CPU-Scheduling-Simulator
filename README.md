# -CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
This repository contains a Java-based simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms. CPU scheduling is a fundamental aspect of operating systems, where the CPU decides the order in which processes are executed. This simulator allows users to visualize and analyze different scheduling algorithms such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), SJN and  Others
